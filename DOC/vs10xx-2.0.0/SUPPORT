This software is released under the GPLv2 licence and therefore free for use
as long as the licence is respected.

However, developing, maintaining and supporting software takes a lot of time.
Unpaid, spare time in my case. If you or your company plan to use this software
for commercial purposes, I would very much appreciate your support in return!

Many thanks,

Richard van Paasen.
